# DATA-Structure-ALG
DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM
A Data Structure Algorithm refers to a set of instructions or steps designed to manipulate, organize, and process data efficiently using specific data structures. Below is a concise overview of key concepts:

1. Common Data Structures
Arrays: Fixed-size, sequential collection of elements.
Linked Lists: Nodes connected by pointers (e.g., singly, doubly linked lists).
Stacks: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure (e.g., undo operations).
Queues: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure (e.g., task scheduling).
Hash Tables: Key-value pairs for fast lookups.
Trees: Hierarchical structures (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees).
Graphs: Nodes (vertices) connected by edges (e.g., social networks).
Heaps: Specialized trees for priority-based operations.
2. Key Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort.
Searching Algorithms:
Linear Search, Binary Search.
Graph Algorithms:
Dijkstra’s Algorithm (shortest path), Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Dynamic Programming:
Solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack).
Divide and Conquer:
Splits problems into smaller subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
Greedy Algorithms:
Makes locally optimal choices (e.g., Kruskal’s, Prim’s).
3. Applications
Web Development: Hash tables for caching, trees for DOM traversal.
Databases: B-trees for indexing.
Networking: Graph algorithms for routing.
AI/ML: Dynamic programming for optimization problems.
