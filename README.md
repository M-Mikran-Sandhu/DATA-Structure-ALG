# Data Structures and Algorithms Showcase

## 1. Project Overview

This repository serves as a collection of C++ and Python implementations of common data structures and algorithms. It is designed for educational purposes, providing clear examples of how these fundamental concepts are put into practice.

A key feature of this project is an HTML generation script (`generate_html.py`). This script automatically creates a browsable web page (`generated_index.html`) that lists all code files in the repository and allows you to view their content directly in your browser, making it easy to explore the various examples.

The main objectives are:
*   To offer practical, understandable examples of data structures and algorithms.
*   To provide a simple and convenient way to navigate and view the codebase.

## 2. Installation Instructions

To work with the examples in this repository, you'll need the appropriate compilers/interpreters.

### C++ Examples
*   **Compiler:** A C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang) is required.
*   **Compilation:** Navigate to the directory containing the C++ source file and compile it using a command similar to:
    ```bash
    g++ -o <output_executable_name> <source_file_name>.cpp
    ```
    For example, to compile `Simple Queue.cpp`:
    ```bash
    g++ -o simple_queue "Simple Queue.cpp"
    ```
    (Note: Files with spaces in their names, like `"Simple Queue.cpp"`, should be quoted in the terminal).

### Python Examples
*   **Interpreter:** Python 3 (version 3.6 or newer recommended) must be installed on your system.
*   **Dependencies:** The Python scripts in this repository generally use standard libraries and do not require separate installation of external packages.

### HTML Code Showcase Generation
*   **Interpreter:** Python 3 is required to run the `generate_html.py` script.
*   **Dependencies:** The script uses standard Python libraries (`os`, `html`, `argparse`) and does not require additional package installations.
*   **Template:** The script uses `index.html` as a template for generating the output file `generated_index.html`.

## 3. Usage Guidelines

### Running C++ Examples
1.  **Compile:** Follow the compilation instructions above.
2.  **Execute:** Run the compiled executable from your terminal:
    ```bash
    ./<output_executable_name>
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    ./simple_queue
    ```
    Most C++ examples provide a command-line menu for interaction.

### Running Python Examples
1.  **Execute:** Run the Python scripts directly from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```
    For example, to run the linked list example:
    ```bash
    python linkedlist.py
    ```
    The `linkedlist.py` script offers an interactive command-line menu.

### Using the HTML Code Showcase
1.  **Generate/Update:** To create or update the HTML showcase, run the `generate_html.py` script from the root of the repository:
    ```bash
    python generate_html.py
    ```
    This will process the files and create/overwrite `generated_index.html`.
2.  **View:** Open the `generated_index.html` file in any modern web browser to explore the repository's code. You can click on file names in the list to view their content.
3.  **Custom Directory (Advanced):** The `generate_html.py` script can also target other directories. For usage details, you can run:
    ```bash
    python generate_html.py --help
    ```

### Expected Outcomes and Known Limitations
*   **Standalone Examples:** Each C++ and Python example is generally self-contained and designed to demonstrate a specific concept. They do not typically interact with each other.
*   **HTML Generator:**
    *   The `generate_html.py` script is designed for text-based code files. It might not correctly display binary files or very large files.
    *   It attempts to handle different character encodings but may encounter issues with highly unusual encodings.
*   **File Naming:** Some C++ files have spaces in their names (e.g., `Age Priorities list.cpp`). This is generally not standard practice and might require careful handling (e.g., quoting file names) when compiling or managing them on the command line. Using quotes as shown in the compilation example is recommended.

## 4. Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to enhance this collection of examples!

### Reporting Issues
*   If you find a bug, a typo, or have trouble with any part of the project, please clearly describe the issue. (If this were a GitHub project, you'd "open an issue on the GitHub repository.") For now, consider documenting it if you fork the project.

### Suggesting Features or New Examples
*   If you have ideas for new data structure/algorithm examples or improvements to existing ones, these are welcome.
*   Provide a clear description of the feature or example and its relevance.

### Submitting Changes (e.g., Pull Requests)
1.  **Fork & Branch:** (Standard Git workflow) Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2.  **Code:**
    *   Ensure new code is well-commented and easy to understand.
    *   If adding new C++ or Python examples, try to keep them self-contained.
    *   Follow the general coding style of the existing examples or use common best practices for the respective language.
3.  **Update HTML Showcase:** If you add, remove, or rename code files, **you must re-run the `generate_html.py` script** to ensure `generated_index.html` is up-to-date:
    ```bash
    python generate_html.py
    ```
    Include the updated `generated_index.html` in your changes.
4.  **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages, explaining the purpose of your changes.
5.  **Submit:** (Standard Git workflow) Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the main repository.
